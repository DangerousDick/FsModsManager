Farming Simulator 22 Mods Folder Manager.
Creates, deletes and managers folders for game, server or map specific mods to avoid confilcts and simplify loading the mods required by multiplayer servers.

NOTE: This application will change the Farming Simulator 2022 file 'gameSettings.xml' to override the default mod folder location.

Written using python3 and QT5.

This is a Windows only application

Aimed at FS22 but may work for FS19 if you change some of the settings in the applications config.ini file under the 'Mods' menu.
More Info under the 'Help' Menu
FS19 HAS NOT BEEN TESTED so is not supported, however, it does use the same values in the 'gameSettings.xml' file.

Code for this application is in my fs22-mod-manager project.
